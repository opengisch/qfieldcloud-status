*Resolved*
- Our upstream provider had a power outage which lead to equipment failing and systems not being reachable. The power has been restored, core routers and hypervisors are back up and running.
- All QFieldCloud Dedicated instances are reachable again.

We’re sorry for the inconvenience caused by this incident.

*Problem ongoing*
- Our upstream provider is currently experiencing problems in one of their datacenters. This issue causes our dedicated QFieldCloud instance to be temporarily unavailable. The upstream provider is working on the problem.
