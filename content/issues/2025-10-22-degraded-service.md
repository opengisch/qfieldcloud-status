*Resolved*
- On October 21 and 22, we experienced intermittent service disruptions caused by high system load.
We upgraded the server resources and adjusted load distribution in order to restore regular service, which seems to have resolved the issue.

*Investigating*
- We are experiencing a service degradation, currently we are investigating the root cause.
