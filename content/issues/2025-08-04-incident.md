We are experiencing stability problems on the system at the moment and are looking into it.

Update 4.8.2025: We were able to recover services and are observing the situation.

Update 9.8.2025: The instabilities surfaced again and we could identify the source. It is related to projects with many files which cause a lot of internal requests and memory usage and therefore take too long to respond. A patch is deployed and being monitored.

Update 11.8.2025: The initial patch did cause unintended side effects and didn't resolve the problem and different attempts to mitigate the issue resulted in service instabilities and problems with accessing the storage backend which prevented some users from uploading files. We have now identified the main source of troubles and are deploying an improved and tested hotfix.

Update 12.8.2025: All systems are running stable and memory usage is on normal levels. In a follow up of this incident, we have improved our monitoring systems to detect such problems earlier.
