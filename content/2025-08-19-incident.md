<!-- *Resolved* -
We believe all users experiencing issues have been able to connect at this time. {{< track "yyyy-mm-dd hh:MM:00" >}}

*Monitoring* -
We believe the connectivity issues are being caused by an isolated ISP issue. We've had reports that swapping to Google DNS servers (see here; https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using) resolves the problem for users. {{< track "yyyy-mm-dd hh:MM:00" >}}
-->
*Investigating*
- We have isolated the core issue and are preparing a patch to be rolled out soon.

*Investigating*
- We are experiencing a service level problem on app.qfield.cloud and have stopped the workers while we are investigating. Jobs are being accumulated and will be processed once the issue is resolved.
