We are experiencing stability problems on the system at the moment and are looking into it.

Update: we were able to recover services and are observing the situation.

Update: the instabilities continued and we could identify the source. It is related to projects with many files which cause a lot of internal requests and therefore take too long to respond. A patch is deployed and being monitored.
